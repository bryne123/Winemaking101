            Q: Do you need a lot of equipment to make wine at home?<br></br> A: Not at
            all. By using our juice kits, you start with an excellent quality
            juice that allows you to skip the pressing, steming and crushing.
            Our starter equipment kit contains all the necessary equipment to
            get you started making outstanding tasting wine.<br></br> Q: Is it expensive
            to make wine? </br> A: Surprisingly, wine making is a very affordable
            hobby. Our wine making starter equipment kits start at very
            reasonable prices. You will also need to purchase juice. We sell
            juice kits. The juice kits contain everything you'll need including
            the juice, yeast, clarifying and stabilizing agents. Each kit yields
            approximately 30 bottles of wine. <br></br> Q: How long does it take to make?<br></br>
            A: Our kits range from 4 to 6 weeks. Yes, you can start a kit today
            and have wine ready to bottle in as little as 4 to 6 weeks! Even
            though your wine has fermented in 4 to 6 weeks it is not ready to
            drink. We recommend that you age your wine for a month or two to
            allow the wine to better develop.<br></br> Q: What comes in the Equipment
            Starter Kits?<br></br> A: We have custom made several different size kits to
            best meet a variety of needs. From a small One Gallon Kit to a
            Deluxe 6 Gallon Kit, we have something to meet everyone's winemaking
            needs. If you plan to make wine by using our concentrate juices, you
            will need a 6 Gallon Kit.<br></br>
